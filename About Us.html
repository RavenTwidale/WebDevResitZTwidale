            <h3>Miss Haydee</h3>
            <p>Haydee is a former primary school teacher with over 15 yearsâ€™ experience,
            working with children from early years to upper key stage 2. Specialising in
            creative arts and early reading and writing interventions, she has a passion
            for turning the dull and mundane into an educational adventure. Going on to
            home educate her 2 teenagers, she has strived to support, advise and guide
            home educating families across the nation through a range of engaging,
            easily accessible, online workshops.</p>
            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to provide a safe and engaging environment for home educated children
            across the nation. With access to a wide variety of subject areas from Maths
            and English to Ancient Greek Mythology and Willow Weaving workshops,
            there will be something for everyone.</p> 
            <p>As well as providing workshops for the children, we also aim to provide parents
            who are new to home education with free, impartial advice for anything relating
            to home education. This can be anything from help with setting up timetables,
            organising exams as an external candidate to help dealing with local
            authorities and officialdom.
